    "# Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It gives an idea of how much the values in the dataset vary from one another. A wider range indicates a more spread-out dataset, while a smaller range indicates a more tightly clustered dataset. For example, consider the following set of data: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. The range is 50 - 10 = 40, which means the data spans a range of 40 units.\n",

    "# Variance: Variance is a measure of how much the values in a dataset deviate from the mean. It is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between each value and the mean, divided by the total number of values. A higher variance indicates that the data is more spread out, while a lower variance indicates that the data is more tightly clustered around the mean. For example, consider the following set of data: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. The mean is 30. The variance is calculated as follows:\n",
    "# variance = [(10 - 30)^2 + (20 - 30)^2 + (30 - 30)^2 + (40 - 30)^2 + (50 - 30)^2] / 5\n",
    "#          = 200 / 5\n",
    "#          = 40\n",
    "        \n",
    "# Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and is expressed in the same units as the data. It is a more intuitive measure of dispersion because it is in the same units as the data. A higher standard deviation indicates that the data is more spread out, while a lower standard deviation indicates that the data is more tightly clustered around the mean. For example, using the same set of data as above, the standard deviation is calculated as follows:\n",
    "# standard deviation = sqrt(variance)\n",
