    "#Encapsulation:\n",
    "#Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. Another way to think about encapsulation is, that it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield. Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class is hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of its own class in which they are declared. As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding. Encapsulation can be achieved by Declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.\n",
