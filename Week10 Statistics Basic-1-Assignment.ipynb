    "# Each level has distinct characteristics and implications for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Nominal Level of Measurement:\n",
    "#At the nominal level, data are categorized into distinct, non-ordered categories or groups. Nominal data only provide labels or names for different groups without implying any order or ranking. Examples of nominal variables include:\n",

    "# Marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced)\n",
    "# Types of fruits (e.g., apple, banana, orange)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ordinal Level of Measurement:\n",
    "#The ordinal level of measurement involves variables that can be categorized into ordered or ranked categories. Unlike nominal data, ordinal data have a natural order, but the intervals between the categories may not be equal. Examples of ordinal variables include:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Educational attainment (e.g., high school diploma, bachelor's degree, master's degree)\n",
    "# Socioeconomic status (e.g., low, middle, high income)\n",

    "\n",
    "# Interval Level of Measurement: \n",
    "#Interval data have equal intervals between values, but there is no true zero point. This means that while it's possible to measure the differences between values, ratios and absolute differences are not meaningful. Examples of interval variables include:\n",

    "\n",
    "# For example, let's consider a study that examines the relationship between income and job satisfaction among employees in a company.\n",
    "# The income variable is a ratio-level variable because it has a true zero point (no income) and equal intervals between values. In contrast, job satisfaction is an ordinal-level variable because it has a specific order or rank, but unequal or non-meaningful differences between categories.\n",
    "# If the researcher were to use a correlation analysis to examine the relationship between these two variables, the result would be incorrect because correlation is only appropriate for ratio-level variables. Instead, a more appropriate statistical test for analyzing the relationship between a ratio-level and ordinal-level variable would be a chi-squared test or a t-test.\n",
